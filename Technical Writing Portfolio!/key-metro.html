        	<p>This short tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up your 4700P's built-in metronome. With this feature, you can insert custom time signatures and beats per measure (BPM).</p>
			<p>First, ensure your keyboard is on. If the indicator light above the power button<span class="material-symbols-outlined">power_settings_new</span> is lit up, you're good to go.</p>
			<p>Press the Metronome button, located to the right of the power button. You should hear clicking noises when it's on. It will click until you press the button again or hold it down to set a precise tempo. (see below)</p>

				<span class="material-symbols-outlined">lightbulb</span>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The metronome is initially set to 100 beats per minute, in 4/4 time. But don't worry! It'll stay where you set it even after you turn off your keyboard.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Changing the beats per minute (BPM)</h2>
			<p>The "1" and "2" buttons to the right of the "Metronome" button speed up or slow down the BPM, respectively. Each button press changes the tempo by five beats. You can set the BPM anywhere between 5 and 300.</p>
			<p>You can also set precise tempos with the following method.</p>
			<p>While holding down the metronome button, press the corresponding keys in the illustration below.
			<ul>
				<li>Start at C1 (the leftmost key on the keyboard).</li>
				<li>Press one key for each number. For example, 1-7-5.</li>
				<li>When you're finished, press E2 (the second E starting from the left).</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Changing the time signature</h2>
			<p>Similar to changing the BPM, to change the time signature, first hold down the "Metronome button." Then,</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Start at C5, the next-to-last C on your keyboard, starting from the left.</li>
				<li>Enter the number of beats per measure, then press <strong>Enter</strong>. Here, <strong>Enter</strong> is C6, the rightmost key. Think of it like this: pressing <strong>Enter</strong> the first time signals the slash in a time signature.</li>
				<li>Then press the corresponding key(s) for the denominator. When you're done, press <strong>Enter</strong> again.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For instance, a time signature of 12/4 would be: C5 > C# > Enter > D♯ > Enter</p>
