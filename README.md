Hello. This is the now-mostly-abandoned profile for Michael Sharber. I left my truck-loading job in December 2022 to become a technical writer, but this never worked out despite all my best efforts. I won't whine here, but I have little if any use for this profile anymore. I'm just keeping it in case. Have a good day.
