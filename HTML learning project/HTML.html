<p>Right now, I'm listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB5HSU-V-DQ" title="森の組曲" target="_blank">Forest Suite</a> by Tatsuya Koumazaki and Febian Reza Pane. (Shinsuke Honda is also fantastic)</p>

<p> Here's an inspiring <a href="/HTML-Learning-Project/SideGarden.jpg">image for Jakki's family castle</a> from my third novel, Yumejo.</p>
<!-- above is an example of CamelCase -->
	
<p>Here's a link to a <a href="../micshar92/David-Foster-Wallace-Quote.html">David Foster Wallace quote.</a></p>

<p>An example of a blockquote:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://tamingyourtech.com/how-to-stop-arguing-on-the-internet/">“It is the mark of a great mind to rise above insults; the most humiliating kind of revenge is to treat your adversary as not worth taking revenge upon. Many have taken slight injuries too deeply to heart in the course of punishing them. The great and noble are those who, like a lordly beast, listen unmoved to the barking of little dogs.” - Seneca the Younger, On Anger</blockquote>

<p>And here's a link to <a href="#Yumejo">that below header.</a></p>

<p>Plus a link to <a href="XHTML.html/#section">a section from the XHTML sample.</a></p>

<h2 id="Yumejo">What does "Yumejo" mean?</h2>
<p>In Japanese, "yume (夢)" means "dream" and "-jo (女)" is a suffix that means "woman" or "girl." So "Yumejo" means <sub>i dunno i made it up</sub> "dream girl." It's the name of an app in my novel by the same name.</p>
<p>One of the characters is princess Jacquelyn Lux Estelle Violette-Worthingham, or <abbr title="ジャッキじゃねえわよ。">Jakki.</abbr> Her fictional address is:</p>
<address>Jacquelyn Lux Estelle Violette-Worthingham, 1 Violette Lane, Thystia, Auros</address>
<p>Her birthday is, I dunno, on the 10<sup>th</sup> of December.<sub> I just now made that up.</sub><br>If I were using Markdown, I'd instead write that previous sentence as:</p>

<pre><code>Her birthday is,          I dunno, on
	 the 10^th^ of December. ~I just now made that up.~</code></pre>
<p>^ hey look the font changed</p>

<h1 id="ooo">This header is out of order</h1>

<p><abbr title="keyboard">kbd</abbr> stands for keyboard and is used to label direct keyboard input for screen readers, I think. For instance, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd> (that was a bad example).</p>
<p>Now let's <var>ping</var> my website and use <var>samp.</var></p>
<samp>PING tamingyourtech.com (35.209.2.124) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from 124.2.209.35.bc.googleusercontent.com (35.209.2.124): icmp_seq=1 ttl=111 time=35.1 ms</samp>
<p>Good! <sub>Is that good?</sub></p>

<p>This sentence has a <span class="naps">span and the text is bigger, too.</span></p>

<p>In another book of mine, Summer Eve, the hard-nosed, serious, loner geneticist Barry brings his cat to work as a comfort animal. This is what I imagine his Maine Coon, Andromeda, looks like:</p>
